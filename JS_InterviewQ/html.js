// HTML Sementic Tags
//?? In HTML, a "block element" starts on a new line and takes up the full width available,
//?  while an "inline element" does not start on a new line and only occupies the space needed by its content,
// ?  essentially flowing with the surrounding text; think of block elements 
//? as separate blocks of content, and inline elements as parts of a text line.
